Peleg Wainberg - 

Existing stages suggestions:
Stage 5: Changed to 66, opened a PR to ShayNehmad/sylvanly-narrower-oxboy, travis gave me the flag. Felt wrong so I re-did the stage.
Stage 7: The face that only part of the tag name is the next stage's branch name was unclear.  Also, I think it's too "passive" - it's very clear that I only need to find the tag name of a given commit.
Stage 9: the loop adds 102 files lol. Also, the hook will always return 1 - was that on purpose?
Stage 10: I didn't even have to read the hook to pass. Maybe make people write a hook and validate it?

Other Suggestions: 
- Add a git bisect stage! it can be cool (and not that hard). Easy part can be manually finding the bad commit, Advanced part can be writing a script that finds it and letting git bisect to the work for you!
- Add people to the leaderboard automatically!
- Add a more advanced rebase exercises.
- Add stages for squash, ammend, reset (different types). Maybe something for stash, restore, clean
