Problems:
* Don't know how to get to the TravisCI build logs - give instructions
* If the original repo is changed the forks that are midway are basically f-ed (branch games won't work). So need
a nuclear option for re-creating the fork (delete all local branches, checkout `start-here`? or delete f-ed branches
and recheckout the current stage. Can add a `local_stage` file under management which might even help for other things)
 * git remote -v
 * git remote add https://github.com/ShayNehmad/make-git-better upstream
 * git fetch upstream
 * delete f-ed local branches
 * git checkout -b f-ed-branch upstream/f-ed-branch
* Which branch to create a pull request to? Make it clearer. Should be the same stage probably.


Hey, first of all the presentation was awesome and so were the challenges and thank you very much for the effort
The good stuff:
* The level of details and understanding of the internals of the objects was awesome, I really enjoyed learning all these stuff and had no idea this is how they work.
* the active presentation was really good and helped passing the information in a good way, much better than regular boring slides presentation
* I mostly think that the entire thing was awesome, and the things I think can be good are more things to add and not things to change, the things that do appear awesome
* The Tron stuff were cool
* The entire infra for the CTF seemed very well tested, thought through and solid.

Things that can be good in my opinion:
* Then -> Than :)
* Don't promote zsh during the presentation, it was weird and off-topic to the actual git stuff
* I was missing some information on the internals of ref logs and how to handle things that are considered "unrevert-able" like reset --hard
* I really wish for some more crysis handling parts, like scenarios in which something is fucked and you need to save if (like reset --hard and going to ref logs)
* the quick passing of the basic stuff wasn't quick enough
* The challenges did not practice much of the "plumbing" commands and mostly basic commands, I believe the entire ordeal could really be expanded into an awesome (probably much bigger) challenge
