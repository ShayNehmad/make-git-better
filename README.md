## Directions

- Have fun :)
- Don't look at any hidden files or directories in this repo (unless you're directed to do so). **Specifically, don't look at the `.travis` or `.management` directories or the `.travis.yml` file. THIS WILL RUIN THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU.**
- This challenge will not require brute-forcing to solve - the solution, once you got it, should be clear.
- You are encourged to use any tool to solve the challenge. However, CLI is preferred to make sure you understand all the commands - save the GUI for day-to-day work.

## Reference materials
  
For how to use a specific command you always have `git help`. For a good explanation of concepts, [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the place to go.

## Stages

### Stage 1

READ ALL THE INSTURCTIONS AND ONLY THEN TRY TO SOLVE THE CHALLENGE. This is true for all stages.

Your first challange is to:

1. **Fork this repository**. You can do this by pressing the "fork" button on top of this page. To learn more about forking and to make sure you understand it, [read this documentation by GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
2. **Clone** your fork to your local development machine. This should look something like `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USER_HERE/make-git-better.git`.
3. **Checkout** the `start-here` branch in the local repository you've just cloned. This should look something like `git checkout start-here`.
4. **Read me again** to unlock the next stage. No more hand-holding ðŸ˜‰

### Stage 2

_WIP in the `start_here` branch_...
